This application is an advanced (in comparison to FileCrypter)
file encryption tool.

1. Improvements in this application.

Following improvements have been made when comparing to simple FileCrypter
- file content is encrypted by randomly generated 16-byte long (128 bit) key
- encryption key is stored in file header but encrypted with user password
- file header contains also marker (letter 'THPS') and application version
to allow future application improvements/extensions.

2. Encrypted file format.

Encrypted file consist of header and payload. Header in version 3 contains
following data:
- marker (4B): letters T, H, P and S
- version (1B): number, starting from 1
* encryption key (16B): encryption key is encrypted using user password
# filename length (1B): length of stored original filename
# filename (*): random bytes added to make key guessing harder
# marker (4B): same marker as at the beginning of header,
allows to check if key is correct

In list above (-) marks plaintext data, (*) marks data encrypted with user
password and (#) marks data encrypted with generated key.

Payload format:
In version 1, 2, 3: file content encrypted with use of generated key

3. Encryption algorithm.

In version 1, 2, 3: in fact there's no real encryption - only byte XORing with
generated key.
